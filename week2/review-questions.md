- What is the difference between an aggregate function and a scalar function?
- What are examples of aggregate and scalar functions?
- What are the different joins in SQL?
  - > We have INNER, OUTER LEFT, OUTER RIGHT, and OUTER FULL joins.  INNER joins only include records with a match in the output (so records where the join condition is true).  OUTER joins includes records with a match *and* all unmatched records from the left, right, or both tables.
  - > The part of the JOIN ```ON album.artist_id = artist.artist_id``` is the join condition.  When the join condition is true for a pair of records, those records are matched together in the output.  90+% of the time, the join condition will be equality based on a foreign key relationship, but you can have various strange join conditions.  A join condition of just TRUE will include all pairs of records in the output and is called a CROSS JOIN.
- What are the different set operations in SQL? Which set operations support duplicates?
  - > UNION, INTERSECT, UNION ALL are good to know.  UNION combines two resultsets removing duplicates, INTERSECT produces results that appear in both of two result sets, and UNION ALL combines two resultsets including duplicates.
